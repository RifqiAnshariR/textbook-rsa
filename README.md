# üìå Description  
**Textbook RSA**  
This is a simple implementation of the **RSA algorithm** following the textbook method. It supports **encryption & decryption** with chunking to ensure that M < n, especially when n is small. 

# üöÄ How to Run  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/RifqiAnshariR/textbook-rsa.git  
   cd Textbook-RSA  
   ```  
2. Run the script with Python (recommended: Python 3.8+):  
   ```bash  
   python main.py  
   ```  

# üìÑ Usage
- Generate RSA public and private keys  
- Encrypt `<file>` into `cipher.dat`  
- Decrypt `cipher.dat` back into `<file>`
